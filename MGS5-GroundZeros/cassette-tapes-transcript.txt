[CHTPS] Chico's Tapes
=====================

[CHTP1] Chico's Tape 1, March 7-8, 1975: Arrival in Cuba
–-------------------------------------------------------
CHI: I made it ashore. I'm in Cuba. Security looks lighter than I thought.
     I wonder where Paz is.

CHI: It's dark, but there are soldiers everywhere. Lots of choppers coming and
     going. Those lights are so bright... Time to get moving.

CHI: I got close to the fence to see if I could spot her. They had a guard
     posted so I got outta there. Guess security is not so light after all.
     I'm coming, Paz...

CHI: I'm OK... I'm... I'm OK...

CHI: I think I found her! It's gotta be Paz!

CHI: No no no... They're looking for me.

SLD: Enough. Quit that struggling. Got him secured. It's a kid.

CHI: I'm...

SHI: I got caught. I'm in a cage. They gave me back my recorder... At least
     whoever finds this will know what happened.

CHI: They're holding others here, too. But still no sign of Paz.

PAZ: Chico?
CHI: Paz?
PAZ: Chico...


[CHTP2] Chico's Tape 2 - March 9-11, 1975: Recordings from his Cell
–------------------------------------------------------------------
PAZ: Don't touch me, you son of a bitch!
CHI: Paz...
SKF: She looks weak. We need her alive.
SLD: Yes, sir.

CHI: ...Paz.
PAZ: Hm?
CHI: You're back early today.
PAZ: Early...
CHI: The sun is still up.
PAZ: Si.
CHI: Y-yeah.
PAZ: Chico.
CHI: Yes?
PAZ: Let us not do this, okay?
CHI: Huh?
PAZ: I do not think I want to talk to you.
CHI: But... I came here to...
PAZ: Just be quiet.
CHI: Uh...
PAZ: Or I'll scream.
CHI: What the... I don't get it.


[CHTP3] Chico's Tape 3 - March 12, 1975: Escorted to Paz's Location
–------------------------------------------------------------------
CHI: Paz!

SLD: On your feet!
CHI: Okay...

CHI: Paz...


[CHTP4] Chico's Tape 4 - March 12, 1975: Interrogation
–-----------------------------------------------------
SKF: You've got company...
SKF: Does it hurt? Talk. Talk! You can speak, can't you? Then talk.
CHI: Okay! Okay...
SKF: Good boy. Your boss and I go way back. Don't count on him coming to rescue
     you. If you're a real soldier, you'll find your own way out. But don't
     bother trying to escape. Let's say you get lucky – and you don't look very
     lucky – and by some miracle you get out of your cage. Let's even say you're
     able to elude the guards. Then what? The nearest Cuban border is four miles
     to the east. Four miles of barren, America-controlled soil. Think you'd
     make it? You wouldn't get any help from the Cubans. And the border's a mess
     of live minefields. Think you'd make it through that? With your girlfriend
     in tow? If you were that lucky, you wouldn't even be here right now. But
     don't lose hope. There's another way out. For both you and the girl. This
     way is... much simpler. I ask, you answer. Easy, right? Just tell me what
     you know.
PAZ: You're dumber than you look. Wasting your time torturing kids.
SKF: Tell me about your base.
PAZ: Chico.
SKF: Well?
PAZ: Chico!
CHI: Hit me.
CHI: Again!
SKF: Hmpf. Trying to impress the girl, little man? How cute. All right. Let's
     try something else.
CHI: Stop it!
SKF: She'll get what she deserves. We were comrades, once. But she betrayed us.
     Deception and deceit. What better proof she's a... real woman. Show him.
PAZ: Do you realize what you're doing?! Cipher is watching. Let go of me! You'll
     be next! Your hideous face wi...
SKF: Repulsive, isn't it? Look. Look carefully. Watch out when you grow up, boy.
     This is the kind of woman you'll want to avoid. Of course, scars like those
     make it rather difficult to lead a normal life. I should know. Continue.
     Talk, and you both go free.
PAZ: Chico, no! Don't...
SKF: Only you can stop this.
PAZ: Don't talk! Chico, please! No!

CHI: Paz. Why?

SKF: Move. Get up.
CHI: Huh?
CHI: You heard me. Do you like what you see?
CHI: ...Huh?
SKF: I said... Do you like what you see? It's like... fruit. Does she look sweet
     or sour? A man has to know these things. Time for a taste test. Either you
     take her – now – or you're strung up next.
PAZ: Don't worry, Chico.
CHI: No... No...
PAZ: It's okay, Chico... You won't hurt me.
CHI: I don't...
SKF: Get on with it.
CHI: I can't...
PAZ: Chico!
CHI: No...
PAZ: Come on.

CHI: ...Out at sea... Staff of 300... but usually there's... ZEKE... Metal
     Gear...
SKF: See? That wasn't so hard.
CHI: You got what you wanted. Aren't you satisfied?!
SKF: We're halfway there.

PAZ: Chico. Chico?
CHI: ... Thought you didn't want to talk to me.
PAZ: There's... one thing I want to say.
CHI: What...?
PAZ: I missed you, Chico.
CHI: ...Yeah.
PAZ: Come here.
CHI: Huh?
PAZ: Closer.
CHI: ...No.
PAZ: ...Sorry.
CHI: Enough already.
PAZ: You want to do it here?


[CHTP5] Chico's Tape 5 - March 13-14, 1975: Negotiation
–------------------------------------------------------
CHI: Come on, Paz. Talk! Please, Paz. I'm doing this for you.
PAZ: Coward!
CHI: How can you say that?!
PAZ: Traitor!
CHI: Don't make me mad! You're only making things worse!
SKF: Take him back to his cage.
CHI: What did I do?
SKF: "Vigyétek a ketrecébe!"
CHI: Give it back! Give it back!
SKF: Enough. She's no good to us dead.

CHI: Can I have it back?
SKF: We've decided to let her go.
CHI: So... she talked. Told her she should've just gotten it over with.
SKF: She's going back to your boss. But only her.
CHI: ...Huh?
SKF: Those were the terms. She said to leave you here. I suppose she doesn't
     much care for you, anymore.
CHI: That... bitch!
SKF: Now, you've got quite a problem on your hands. When she gets back, what
     will she say? That you talked? Sold out your comrades? Your... family?
     You're finished.
CHI: You mean I... I can't go home?
SKF: There's very little I can do for you. And I still have need of your...
     services.
CHI: Huh?
SKF: You're going to call your boss – for help. We'll make a recording, play it
     across public frequency bands.
CHI: To bring him here...? Yeah, right. You expect me to trust you? I'll never
     help you.
SKF: Perhaps. But If you did... I wouldn't mind looking the other way if he did
     come for you. Take some guards off duty, let you quietly slip away. But...
     You wouldn't want the girl leaving here alive. She'd have to be eliminated
     before he came. There's no other way.
CHI: Mm...
SKF: I'll leave you to think it over. Chico. Growing up means choosing how
     you're going to live your life.


[CHTP6] Chico's Tape 6 - March 14-15, 1975: Chico's Distress Call
–----------------------------------------------------------------
CHI: Snake, it's Chico. I need your help. Cipher's holding me on a U.S. military
     base in Cuba. Paz is here too. We're at the prison area at the coast. There
     are some cages to the east of a big building. It's an old, grassy facility.
     That's where we are. Help me, Snake...

PAZ: Don't... Don't do it...
SKF: Kid's a natural, don't you think? What do you think Big Boss will do? He'll
     know it's a trap, but he'll come anyway. That's the kind of man he is.
PAZ: Don't.
SKF: Thanks to your report a nuclear inspection team's being sent to their base.
     The scientist was our way in. It all ends soon, exactly as I've planned.
     All thanks to you.
PAZ: Cipher... would never...
SKF: Yes, Cipher will surely mourn his death. I'll have no choice but to
     distance myself from the group. And then they'll eliminate you. No one will
     be left. Think about that. Big Boss or Cipher – you can only save one.
PAZ: I will never talk.
SKF: I don't expect you to believe me. The question is, which of the two would
     you like to give a shot at survival?
PAZ: What I would like... is to kill you.
SKF: The feeling is mutual. But... We're secret agents. Restraint is a virtue.
SKF: Your favorite song. Nicola. Bart. Immigrants, wrongly executed. But their
     deaths served as a message to others. That ours is a society that murders
     the innocent. Do you, too, believe your sacrifice will change the world?
     If so, the time is now. Cipher's been in hiding ever since his grand
     experiment. No one's seen him in years. All we hear are orders delivered by
     proxy. Except you. You met with him – face to face – in order to contact
     Big Boss. Tell me where he is. Where is Cipher... Where is Zero? I've never
     known choice. Where I was born, the language I speak... I've never had the
     freedom to choose for myself. But you, right now, are free. Do as you will.
PAZ: This will save Big Boss?
SKF: It may.
PAZ: Will you really kill Zero for me?
SKF: Not for you.
PAZ: Alright... Zero is...


[CHTP7] Chico's Tape 7 - March 15, 1975: Bargaining with Paz (Final Recording)
–------------------------------------------------------–----------------------
???: Give her the shot already!
MED: Hold her still!
???: Prep the package.

MED: She's all closed up.
???: Timer's set per your instructions.
SKF: We can't have her waking up – or dying – on us...
MED: I gave her a transfusion, a nutrient cocktail, and an anesthetic.
SKF: How long does she have?
MED: 24 hours – same as her cargo. She won't last [much] longer than that.
     To make room for the bomb, I removed organs she won't need.
SKF: Almost there. Now for the second one. In a place they'd never look.
SKF: Hang her up.
SKF: You shall not see triumph. You've been most helpful. And I have one last
     use for you. To you I give a magnificent end... But an end nonetheless.
     The final moment is yours.
SLD: We heard from the advance team – everything's right on schedule. The C4 has
     been planted on the legs. Strike team and decoy team are in position. And,
     we have confirmation that Big Boss'[s] chopper has lifted off.
SKF: A shame I won't see him. But at least I'll get a look at his body. Time for
     us to move out, too... But first, let's stop by and see the boy. I want Big
     Boss to hear his little diary. Hopefully he's still a good listener.
SKF: Give this to the boy as a reward...and a memento. Make copies.
SLD: Yes, sir.
SKF: First Big Boss, then Zero. Liberation is at hand.
PAZ: Chico. I am borrowing your recorder. Hope you do not mind. I know it hurts
     right now, but it will all be over soon. Just thinking that helps keep the
     pain away. Chico... I would do anything to get you out of here. It is
     funny... I have never helped anyone else before, only Cipher. That is the
     truth. I... I never imagined you would come for me. I was not very nice at
     first, I know. But I did not mean it. I...I was afraid they would try to
     use you, somehow. But, to be honest... Having you with me here put my mind
     at ease. I hope that does not sound selfish. I thought I would never make
     it. But together, I think we can. I am watching you sleep as I record this.
     You have made me believe. That I will make it out of here... And that – no
     matter what happens – it will not be the end for me. Thank you, Chico.


[AGNTR] Agent's Recording - Secretly Recorded POW Interrogation
–--------------------------------------------------------------
SKF: I needed this place, to listen to the words people had to say. That's
     something they could never understand. You've done your part. You told us
     plenty. You've known the pain of ages. And even now you think, as any
     person would, that this can't be happening. Is it education? Morals, faith?
     Just the imprint of a lifetime of stories? Face to face with oblivion,
     which is where you are, and you still think that help is coming. The world
     you were born into is made to save you. Isn't that right? Of course it is.
     Everyone knows that. Until your last breath, you know it. Without the
     slightest chance or reason left to them, humans are capable of hope. I'm no
     different. But for one thing. When my time came calling I didn't die. My
     family died, my country died, but they didn't take me with them. All Hell
     took from me was this skin, this outer peel that marked me "human."
SKF: My village had an oilseed field and a fine factory. Every day my friends
     and I would see our parents at work in that factory. That's all I had. All
     the world I knew. Then one day, aircraft came droning in from some far-off
     sky. The factory was bombed. Some... "spies" had told them we were making
     weapons. The building burned. We tried to flee outside. The crowd blocked
     the exit. The crowd of people. Hot. So hot. I tried to push through their
     legs and get ahead, but a boot in my stomach put me on the ground. The
     smoke of them burning filled me up. I heard my name called... but not for
     long.
SKF: At the infirmary they carried me to, a nurse in the corridor saw me and
     remarked, as if it happened every day: "They should let the poor thing
     die." Those are the only words of my mother tongue I remember. It was the
     language of my village. Until foreign troops invaded. Then the last
     identity I had left – the words I spoke – were pulled from me. My skin
     would never feel anything again. This face would be burned again, in
     torture, at foreign hands, but I, I still writhe in that burning factory.
     Doused in scalding rapeseed oil. That's all I have to feel, that pain – all
     I have to remind me I exist here.
SKF: Those "spies" reported well. We made weapons all right. As cartloads of
     rifles came in from the battlefields, we fixed them up and sent them back
     out. So our country could win. Or rather, so that little world we knew
     could continue. I came to realize I mustn't die. I'm their last hope, all
     those who perished and left me here. I have to accomplish something. If I
     don't, their will will be swept out of this world.
SKF: So? Do you see me now? Tell me. What do you see? Hmm? You have eyes. What
     do your eyes see? Yes, that's right. You see a skull face. You see me. This
     skull is who I am. My mark, my proof of humanity. I have no country, no
     language, I have no face, but I haven't lost my skull. So I told myself...
     The pain and effort that keep me alive will never know relief, never bear
     fruit, never be repaid. I know that, but I told myself to focus on some
     hope, a nonexistent hope to guide me through this burning world. A hope –
     call it a dream. A melancholic delusion. As the pressures within me stretch
     me to bursting, and I force myself not to cry out, though the words I
     thought were carved into me are gone, and all I knew is dead. I know how
     you feel. I've felt that. So show me. That I'm not the only one. That you
     too can return to this world, for revenge. Do you see me. Don't die. Don't
     die!





[PREMB] Pre-mission Brief: Mission Background & Intel
=====================================================

[BRFMT] Mission Tips
–-------------------
KAZ: This is a one-man infiltration mission, Boss. Equipment is the bare
     essentials. Anything else will be OSP. The target location is a prison camp
     in a U.S. military base. Those Marines have the place locked down tight.
     Your only backup will be one extraction chopper. We can't send anything
     else.
BIG: You won't need to.
KAZ: Again, this is infiltration – a sneaking mission. Your number one priority
     is remaining undetected. Use discretion before engaging any guard you
     encounter. Be mindful of their sensory perceptions – sight, sound, smell...
     and pain. Fortunately, these atmospheric conditions will continue until
     dawn. That should provide you with some cover.
BIG: Least the weather's on my side.


[BRFMO] Mission Objectives: Target Intel
–---------------------------------------
KAZ: Your mission objective is to rescue Chico and Paz. According to Chico,
     they're both being held at an old prison facility. Recon from the Intel
     Unit supports this, so it's safe to assume that's where they are. Once
     you've gotten them to the RV, call in the extraction chopper. I'll monitor
     the situation and offer guidance from here. But you'll be the one in the
     field. How you handle this mission is entirely up to you, Boss.


[BRF01] Brief 1: Nuclear Inspection Demand by the IAEA
–-----------------------------------------------------
KAZ: Snake, yesterday, we received official communication from the IAEA. It
     says, "It has come to our attention that your organization recently
     purchased nuclear fuel from Uzbekistan authorities. We request permission
     to inspect your facilities."
BIG: What a load of bullshit.
KAZ: Yeah. They're after Metal Gear ZEKE's nuclear warhead. I'm betting this is
     payback from Cipher after Paz's leak.
BIG: Using the UN?
KAZ: There's no telling how much influence they have. But the IAEA can only do
     inspections in countries that are party to the NPT.
BIG: And we're not a country.
KAZ: Exactly. We haven't signed a safeguards agreement with the IAEA over
     peaceful nuclear use, and we're not obligated to report any nuclear
     material we have, nor information about any nuclear facilities. The IAEA
     has no authority to inspect us.
BIG: But despite all that...
KAZ: That nuke's our last line of defense. We don't want to announce we have it
     until the world is preparing to wipe us off the map. Until then, we let
     everyone think we're just a private army with conventional firepower.
BIG: What's Huey's take?
KAZ: That the problem's how to hide the nuke and Metal Gear. But I gotta tell
     you, he was all for it.
BIG: I see... But there's no way we can have the IAEA poking around here.
KAZ: So what do we do? Ignore [th]'em?
BIG: Send them an official letter of refusal. Say that we're a private
     organization, and we've done nothing to attract this suspicion.
KAZ: You got it.


[BRF02] Brief 2: Allowing the Nuclear Inspection
–-----------------------------------------------
HUE: We finished ZEKE's waterproofing reinforcement yesterday. The day after
     tomorrow we'll be done installing the main depth control tank, the
     compressed air tank, and the attitude control propeller pod.
KAZ: Huey.
HUE: If the underwater test goes well, next week we'll try the 300-foot seabed
     depth.
KAZ: Drop the act, Huey. How did we end up agreeing to the nuclear inspection?
HUE: ... Because after you sent that letter I told them, "After careful
     reconsideration we agree to your request." And frankly, we should be
     inspected. This is our chance. If they come and go without discovering the
     nuke, we can tell the world we're clean. Of course it's risky, and we'll
     have to make sure everything's perfect. But it'll be worth it.
BIG: Huey, can they do an inspection without going through the Board of
     Governors?
KAZ: We contacted the IAEA's admin branch, and they said there's no record of us
     being brought up at any of the Board's meetings.
HUE: I'd say... probably a preliminary inspection to determine whether we should
     be referred to the Board. So it's bound to be a small inspection team, and
     they won't be here that long. Don't worry, leave everything to me.
BIG: Has the media gotten wind of this?
HUE: Yeah. Two major Western networks want to do stories on us. I'd planned on
     saying yes.
KAZ: What?! You want to broadcast this place to the world?
HUE: That's why I agreed to the inspection. This is a golden opportunity. We can
     use the media to prove to the world we don't have a nuke. Besides, even if
     we said no, it would just be delaying the inevitable.
BIG: Kaz, our hands are tied now. Start getting the place ready.
HUE: Thanks, Boss.
BIG: Don't get the wrong idea. You've set it up so that any more "changes of
     heart" will arouse suspicion, that's all.
KAZ: ZEKE stays, but we'll have to move all other AFVs to shore. Any potential
     troublemakers can go with them for some mandatory R&R. Sound good, Boss?
BIG: Just do it.


[BRF03] Brief 3: Preparing Staff for the Inspection
–--------------------------------------------------
BIG: About the inspection. What do we tell the men?
KAZ: The truth – what else? The one thing we don't need to worry about is anyone
     here spilling the beans about ZEKE.
BIG: Good point. What about the Sandinistas? There's still quite a few of them
     left on the base.
KAZ: I hate to say it, but it won't look good having Soviet Bloc personnel
     here... The problem is, moving a group that size in a hurry would look even
     worse.
BIG: At least Amanda's on assignment in Cuba. They'd recognize her. She should
     stay put for now.
KAZ: All civilians, save Huey, will have to return to their countries.
BIG: Even your Parisienne?
KAZ: Of course. We'll get her whatever papers she needs. Dr. Strangelove's
     departure came at a perfect time. The less ZEKE-related staff here the
     better.
BIG: Wait, she left?
KAZ: That's right, you were away on a mission. She left last week. There's
     nothing cooking in AI weapons research, and ZEKE is complete. There was
     really no reason for her to hang around.
BIG: I'm surprised Huey let her go that easy.
KAZ: Yeah, his crush on Strangelove was never much of a secret, huh. He followed
     her everywhere while ZEKE was in development. Boy, would she get pissed.
     But he does have a lot on his mind right now. "I've got bigger issues to
     deal with"... That's what he said.
BIG: That's the spirit, Huey.


[BRF04] Brief 4: Word on Paz's Survival
–--------------------------------------
KAZ: Ten days ago, we got reports that Paz was still alive.
BIG: She survived?
KAZ: She was rescued by a Belizean fisherman who found her drifting in the
     Caribbean.
BIG: So what's the plan? Silence her before we're compromised?
KAZ: No, I've got something else in mind. Our "friends" at Cipher suspect Paz
     could be a double agent. She's being held for interrogation at a camp on
     the southern tip of Cuba.
BIG: Black site – nice. A slice of American pie on communist soil, and out of
     U.S. legal jurisdiction.
KAZ: The upcoming inspection of Mother Base has to be connected somehow. The
     timing's too perfect.
BIG: The UN's nuclear inspection...
KAZ: My guess is they're trying to corroborate Paz's leak.
BIG: We're an army without a nation.
KAZ: Word of our capabilities gets out, and we'll have the whole world out to
     shut us down. Having an American private intelligence agency involved's
     bad news. Cipher's the ones who sent Paz to us in the first place.
BIG: She knows their true nature.
KAZ: Right. Paz is our only link to Cipher. If she's still alive... ...We need
     her on our side. If not us, who else is gonna rescue that bitch?
BIG: When do we do it?
KAZ: The inspection comes first. We'll deal with this afterward[s].
BIG: Do the men know?
KAZ: Word has started to spread. The information came from Cuba through Amanda.
     One of the base personnel used to belong to El Frente. I'll tell everyone,
     "We don't concert ourselves with the survival of enemy spies." We need them
     focused on the inspection. And if we get her back here and she isn't...
     cooperative, there's still plenty of room for her in the ocean.
BIG: Works for me. What about Chico? He had a chance to stop Paz from hijacking
     ZEKE, and he blew it. He's carried that guilt ever since. {The} kid really
     did care about her.
KAZ: Chico... It's hard to say how he'll react.
BIG: Have Amanda call him out to Cuba. He shouldn't be here right now.
KAZ: Good idea. They haven't seen each other in a while. {A} little time with
     big sis and he'll forget all about you-know-who.


[BRF05] Brief 5: Chico Vanishes
–------------------------------
KAZ: What? Still no sign of Chico?
BIG: What's going on?
KAZ: It's Amanda in Cuba. Our resupply package arrived, but Chico wasn't with
     it.
KAZ: Relax, Amanda. I'm sure he's just... exploring Havana or something. First
     time in the big city, he could've gotten carried away...
BIG: Kaz, wait. The boat Chico was on – did it stop anywhere before it got to
     Havana?
KAZ: Yeah, it had to refuel at Santiago de Cuba... You don't think... Aw shit,
     you gotta be kidding me! He does this NOW?!
BIG: It's 60 miles from Santiago to the prison camp. Chico used to cross the
     mountains with the older Sandinistas like it was nothing. He'll make that
     in three days.
KAZ: Still, even if he does find his way there...
BIG: You know how reckless he can be. Chico thinks we've abandoned Paz. That's
     why he's doing this.
KAZ: ... We'll start by having the Intel detachment in Cuba look for him. We
     can't let him be captured.


[BRF06] Brief 6: Chico's Distress Call
–-------------------------------------
CHI: There are some cages to the east of a big building. It's an old, grassy
     facility. That's where we are. Help me, Snake...
KAZ: It's a setup.
BIG: We have no choice.
KAZ: Yeah. If Chico talks, he could blow the nuke cover-up. We can't hold off
     until the inspection's over.
BIG: When can we be ready?
KAZ: It'll take at least 16 hours to confirm the flight path and prep a bird.
     The Intel Unit has started reconning the area.
BIG: Sounds like I'll have to miss the inspection.
KAZ: Boss, we'll just have to send someone else to get them out.
BIG: No, I'll go.
KAZ: Yeah. Chico and Paz would only take orders from you anyway. And we can't go
     taking on those Marines at the base head-on. It's gotta be off-the-rader...
     And it's gotta be you.
BIG: Hold down the fort, Kaz.


[MINTL] Mission Intel: US Military Base, Cuba
–--------------------------------------------
KAZ: Snake. You can forget about civil liberties where you're headed. God only
     knows what they'd do to you if you got caught. Do not let that happen. The
     Cubans leased the land to the U.S. as a gesture for helping them gain
     independence from Spain. The deal remains in effect until both countries
     agree to dissolve it or the U.S. abandons the land. That's why America
     still operates the base even after la revolución. Problem is, it's leased
     land.
BIG: Meaning it isn't American soil, so the U.S. Constitution doesn't apply
     there. That allows them to withhold its civil rights protections.
KAZ: Yeah, that's Uncle Sam's excuse. The area was originally only for detaining
     refugees from countries like Cuba and Haiti. But a few years ago, the CIA
     and its like started using it as a black site. Enemies of the state are
     renditioned there and subjected to extreme forms of interrogation. You can
     bet Cipher had a hand in that. As you'd expect, American and other Western
     human rights organizations aren't allowed anywhere near the place. What
     happens there disappears down the memory hole.
BIG: Who knows what they're doing to Chico and Paz.
KAZ: I'd like to interrogate her ourselves, but if worse comes to worst, make
     sure she's dead. Chico, on the other hand, we have to bring back – fast.
     He knows too much about us.
BIG: Kaz.
KAZ: The area's surrounded by mines placed by both the U.S. and Cuba, making
     escape on foot impossible. You're heading onto the lion's den, Snake.
     Don't take this one lightly. Come back in one piece.
BIG: Yeah.





[PAZSL] Paz's Spy Log: Big Boss & Mother Base
=============================================

[PSLTD] Paz's Tape is Discovered
–-------------------------------
BIG: I heard about Paz's tapes...
KAZ: Yeah. Why do you think she'd leave 'em behind? And that diary...
BIG: Whatever it was, her commitment was wavering – that much <is|was> clear.
KAZ: So she was leaving clues? To help us...?
BIG: No way to know for sure. And the ocean's not giving her back.


[PSL01] Paz's Report 1: Contact with BIG BOSS (Colombia, November 4, 1974)
–-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAZ: November 4, 1974, at the outskirts of Barranquilla, Colombia. Contact with
     Big Boss successful. Zadornov posed as my professor, but Big Boss took one
     look and knew he was KGB. However, he does not seem to suspect me. To him,
     I am just a peace-loving student, and another victim of the CIA. We asked
     him to drive the CIA out of Costa Rica. To him, this means betraying his
     country. His forces are smaller than anticipated. They drift from place to
     place, with nowhere to call home. That provided us an opportunity, so we
     seized it. Zadornov offered them a plant off the Costa Rican coast – to
     use as a base. As expected, Miller jumped at the chance. Although initially
     reluctant, Big Boss came around when Zadornov played him the tape. All
     because the voice on it sounded like his mentor, The Boss.


[PSL02] Paz's Report 2: Big Boss
–-------------------------------
PAZ: Naked Snake, the man who once saved the world from the brink of nuclear
     war. Awarded the title of "Big Boss" for his service, he later became a
     mercenary, abandoning both his title and his country. To him, that "honor"
     was steeped in the blood of The Boss, the mentor he was force to eliminate.
     Exceptionally charismatic, he possesses unparalleled combat and
     intelligence gathering abilities. His only discernible weakness is...her.
     This operation hinges on how effectively we can exploit that.


[PSL03] Paz's Report 3: Big Boss's right-hand man, Kazuhira Miller
–-----------------------------------------------------------------
PAZ: Kazuhira Miller is Big Boss'[s] lieutenant. Half Japanese, half American,
     he once served in Japan's Self-Defense Force. Though he and Snake first met
     as enemies, they discovered a common bond and together built their private
     army, with Miller directing business and administrative affairs. He comes
     off as shallow, but his true intent is hard to read. I must be careful. All
     that is clear is his infatuation with Big Boss.


[PSL04] Paz's Report 4: The Peace Walker Project (Costa Rica)
–------------------------------------------------------------
PAZ: With East and West fighting over its control, Central America is now the
     most contested region on earth. CIA Central American Station Chief Coldman
     has developed Peace Walker, a fully AI-automated, fail-deadly nuclear
     launch system with which he aims to reignite the Cold War. Snake's new
     objective in Costa Rica is to prevent that. Zadornov's... or should I say,
     the KGB's plan is to play the two sides against each other, turning the
     entire region Red. Not one of the three parties realize they are all just
     pawns in Cipher's hands. Cipher watches all.


[PSL05] Paz's Report 5: Mother Base Expands
–------------------------------------------
PAZ: Mother Base has developed rapidly since being established in the Caribbean
     Sea. They recruit more personnel daily, and already their mercenary
     services are turning a profit. Big Boss'[s] leadership and charisma and
     Miller's business acumen drive this impressive growth. Furthermore, joining
     forces with a faction of the FSLN has expanded their power even more. They
     have even commenced their own weapons development program. All is
     proceeding according to Cipher's will... I could not be more pleased.


[PSL06] Paz's Report 6: Mammal Pod (Peace Walker's AI)
–-----------------------------------------------------
PAZ: Snake's pursuit of Peace Walker led him to an A.I. modeled after The
     Boss'[s] thought patters. It was incomplete, but – somewhat ironically -
     making contact with Snake was the necessary finishing touch. Meanwhile,
     the scientist behind Peace Walker's locomotive control, Huey, defected
     to Snake's army. His presence has greatly accelerated weapons development
     at Mother Base.


[PSL07] Paz's Report 7: Battle in Nicaragua
–------------------------------------------
PAZ: I failed to anticipate Coldman's madness, but nuclear was was averted.
     However, this was only after The Boss A.I. on board Peace Walker sank
     itself into the bottom of the lake... in what could be likened to suicide.
     The Boss laid down her gun, choosing to sing for peace instead. And Snake,
     himself a gun, parted ways with her. In doing so, he reclaimed the title he
     once abandoned. He is Big Boss.


[PSL08] Paz's Report 8: Infiltration of Mother Base
–--------------------------------------------------
PAZ: Zadornov has been detained. Since this leaves my cover identity without a
     guardian, the Mother Base staff has taken me in. I <am|'m> now better
     placed than ever to monitor their internal affairs. Everything continues to
     unfold according to plan. The developer of The Boss A.I., Dr. Strangelove,
     has also come to Mother Base. With her and Huey's expertise, they can now
     develop a weapon capable of matching Peace Walker.


[PSL09] Paz's Report 9: Metal Gear ZEKE Completed
–------------------------------------------------
PAZ: Development of the bipedal weapon is now complete. They call it Metal Gear
     ZEKE. It stands there like some sort of...mystical guardian. The soldiers
     gaze on it with pride and reverence. Big Boss has elected to arm it with a
     nuclear weapon. As an army without a nation, they seem to feel the need for
     a deterrent against whatever the world might pit against them. It <is|'s> a
     dangerous gambit. Why do such a thing...? Their nuclear strategy differs
     from the Americans and Soviet Union. The superpowers deter attack by
     revealing their nuclear arsenals to one another. Snake and his men know
     that if they were to go public with this, the whole world would unite
     against them. Business would dry up overnight. So, they do not plan on
     revealing the nuke until necessary. This "ace-in-the-hole" approach is
     their idea of a nuclear strategy. Wielding a deterrent, all the while
     unable to reveal its existence. I wonder if Snake sees how vulnerable this
     makes them...


[PSLR1] Communications Record 1 (correspondent unknown)
–------------------------------------------------------
PAZ: Yes... Hijack ZEKE? Yes, I did indicate that to be our leverage... But I
     cannot imagine his agreeing to that now. But... Did you not raise them to
     safeguard yours "governance without borders"...? No, no... I have not
     forgotten. "Cipher watches all."


[PSLR2] Communications Record 2 (correspondent unknown)
–------------------------------------------------------
PAZ: Yes, things are...proceeding. But modifying ZEKE has not proven easy. I'm
     using Zadornov to buy some time. No, I have not forgotten what you said.
     However... Well, forgive me for asking, but... this is you I am speaking
     to, isn't it... Cipher?
PAZ: I must... I will fight Big Boss. The world must be ruled by a single
     will... To defy Cipher is a fate worse than death.





[PAZDI] Paz's Diary
===================

[PDI01] Paz's 1st Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: As of today I will be living here at Mother Base. Now my real trial begins.
     Zadornov was paying my room, board, and tuition, but he has since been
     captured. I told the man that with no more money from the KGB, I could no
     longer afford school. ...He bought my story, and when I said I would be
     willing to work, he took pity on me and let me stay. For some reason Miller
     really plead my case. That was helpful, but the man is still a fool. His
     men are no better. They think their training makes them strong, but that
     kind of strength is nothing in the face of true power. And better yet, they
     wait on me hand and foot, believing I am just a schoolgirl. Looks like I
     won't be working too hard, after all. Just today, while scouting out the
     living quarters, I saw a group of them in the corner of the deck making a
     fuss. Going over for a look, I saw they were feeding a kitten. A bunch of
     grown, hard men, and they are the ones acting like schoolgirls! "Look,
     isn't he cute?" What is wrong with them? Disgusted, I just nodded and
     smiled. I must stay in character, after all. I indulged their chit-chat for
     a few moments, then one of them asked me to give the thing a name. They had
     just taken it from its mother. I named it Nuke. I improvised some nonsense
     about how "our compassion for living things can help prevent wars." The men
     gave me a little fish. I held it out in my palm, and the kitten happily ate
     it up. What a pathetic... feeble creature. It sickens me.


[PDI02] Paz's 2nd Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: Today Chico invited me to go fishing with the soldiers. I suppose finding
     one's own food does have its merit, but I prefer not to be involved in such
     a degrading task. And their prattling on about fishing being "fun" is
     nonsense. I'm not here to find playmates. Nevertheless, distasteful as it
     was, I went along in order to maintain my cover. Chico thrust a fishing
     pole into my hands, and we went up onto the deck, where several soldiers
     had gathered. They welcomed us warmly. With so few women aboard Mother
     Base, I'm treated like a princess. No one suspects I'm neither a teenager
     nor a student. It was nice and sunny, with a gentle breeze and waves. As I
     cast my line and waited for a bite, the soldiers began to ask me all sorts
     of questions. As always, I answered according to our pre-defined scenario,
     feigning a smile. As I sat there feeding them lies, the fish began to bite,
     and the soldiers began to focus on their prey. Chico had his bait stolen by
     a fish, and got so angry that he stood up and nearly fell into the sea.
     Everybody laughed. It almost made me want to join in, too. At some point, I
     got a bite myself. The instant after I felt that first gentle tug, the fish
     yanked the line with astonishing strength, and I let out a cry of surprise.
     I thought it was going to be huge. It was my first time fishing, and I was
     a bit flustered, so the soldier beside me helped by supporting the pole
     from behind. "Reel it in!" they shouted. I nodded, turning the handle as
     fast as I could. I wondered what kind of fish live below the surface, and
     thought back to the deep-sea dives I had to do as part of training. Those
     were difficult days, but I remember finding the multi-colored fish gliding
     through the water incredibly soothing. After a hard fight, I pulled it up.
     To my surprise, it wasn't even half a vara . Rather anti-climactic. But I
     wasn't doing it for fun, so I wasn't the least bit disappointed. Nuke was
     hovering nearby with an expectant look on his face, so I gave the fish to
     him. All in all, a thoroughly wasted day.


[PDI03] Paz's 3rd Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: Preparations are coming along nicely. No one suspects me of being the one
     to let Zadornov out of his cell. Today, Amanda and I taught Cecile how to
     make gallo pinto. It is a simple, home-cooked dish consisting of black
     frijoles mixed with arroz. It is well-known throughout Central America, not
     just in Costa Rica, so it is no surprise that a Nica like Amanda would be
     good at making it. But I was raised in the States from a very young age and
     can hardly even remember my mother's gallo pinto. Having to make chit-chat
     with that clueless bird-lover and the so-called revolutionary was
     excruciating. And - clueless or not - I will need to be especially careful
     around Cecile, the one who actually recorded that tape. Thankfully, Miller
     and his men seem to believe I mistook the tape I found for one my friend
     made... In any case, one can never be too careful. ...Anyway, the three of
     us minced garlic and herbs, then cooked them in a pot with frijoles we'd
     soaked overnight. While waiting for them to cook, we sautéed onions and
     arroz in a frying pan. Cecile worked the frying pan according to Amanda's
     directions, but seemed a bit glum. She does have a knack for cooking,
     though - she is French, after all. We added water to the pan, and watched
     the arroz begin to steam. While we waited, Amanda shared memories of her
     mother with us. They had been separated because of Somoza, but the taste of
     her mother's cooking was still fresh in her mind. When the frijoles were
     ready, we drained the water, stir-frying them with the rest of the
     vegetables. Quite a complicated process for home-cooking. Nonetheless, it
     kept them occupied. The longer we sat and talked, the greater the chance of
     my arousing their suspicions. With women, it is not enough to just to bat
     your eyelashes and giggle. It takes a lot of effort to divert attention.
     When the arroz was done cooking, we folded it into the frijoles and added
     salsa, stirring the mixture as it simmered. At this point, for some reason
     the conversation turned to romance. Why does it have to be that way
     whenever women get together and chat? Cecile fancies herself to be well-
     versed in such matters, and gave Amanda all sorts of advice. It was
     harmless enough until, to my irritation, she began pestering me whether
     there was anybody I "liked." "Not right now," I said, trying to dodge the
     question. But she pressed on. "It's Snake, isn't it?" I gritted my teeth
     and played it coy: "Maybe." Cecile nodded and giggled, "He <is|'s> pretty
     sexy, isn't he?" What a ditz. It's all I can manage to just survive. The
     thought of romance has never once crossed my mind. I've no interest in that
     kind of man. Soon enough, a rich aroma began to fill the room - the gallo
     pinto was ready. Nuke came over and rubbed up against our legs, looking for
     a handout. Unfortunately, it was not the kind of food a cat would like. We
     let a few of the soldiers have a bite and then headed off to the mess hall.
     The home-cooked flavor we'd achieved was a big hit with the men of MSF. Not
     that we are trying to impress them or anything. Even I could manage a dish
     like that. Snake enjoyed it, too... Let me make this absolutely clear: I
     have no interest in that man.


[PDI04] Paz's 4th Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: Futbol, or "soccer" as it is known in the states, is extremely popular
     here. It has not caught on yet in the US, but it has legions of rabid fans
     all across Latin America. These fans can get so rowdy that it is commonly
     believed El Salvador and Honduras went to war in 1969 over scuffles in a
     soccer match. In reality, tensions between the two countries were already
     high. The match was merely one of the sparks that set them off. But these
     people are so passionate about the sport that the story seems plausible.
     Predictably, many of the soldiers here are fans. They have apparently
     divided themselves into Costa Rican and Nicaraguan teams and started
     playing each other. To play, you need a ball and two goals. The R&D team
     built and set up simple goals on the deck. I had absolutely no interest,
     but Chico insisted that I come and watch. It was not a proper match by any
     means - the pitch was not even regulation size - but the players and
     spectators alike got pretty excited. They banged empty cans and shouted
     cheers through the handmade megaphones. It almost felt like Carnival. Huey,
     the referee, blew a whistle to start the match. The soldiers' training has
     left them in excellent physical shape. But they lacked the honed skills of
     professionals, and their play was quite rough. Midway through, one of the
     men collided with another. They started shouting at one another, but Huey
     stepped in. "I thought we had forsaken our countries, become one with the
     earth," he said, quoting Snake. "We're not competing for national pride
     here. And we are not fighting for the good of any one country." "This is
     not a war. Soccer <is|'s> a peaceful sport, am I right?" The soldiers
     nodded. They know the pain of war, and they share Snake's vision. Perhaps
     that is why this all resonates with them. Team Costa Rica was down a man,
     and somehow I was picked to fill in. Costa Rica had the advantage up until
     that point - I suppose Huey wanted to keep it balanced. The soldiers agreed
     with Huey's call. Maybe the Costa Rican players felt an even match up would
     be more fun, too. I could not be bothered to run at first, but chasing the
     ball out there in the hot sun, I was soon drenched in sweat. Before long I
     found myself actively seeking out the ball, partially out of desperation. I
     picked up a loose ball deep on the opponents' side of the field. Even
     though he's Nicaraguan, Chico cheered me on, yelling "Go for it! Shoot!" I
     launched that ball as hard as I could, only to have it blocked by the
     keeper. Disappointment only increased my determination. In the end, I
     didn't score a single goal, and Costa Rica gave up its lead. It was really
     close, though. We congratulated each other on a good match and sprawled out
     in the shade on the deck, exhausted. The ocean breeze felt so nice on my
     sun-soaked body. Nuke came over - it is one of his favorite spots - and
     stretched out next to me. And together we watched fluffy white clouds drift
     lazily across the clear blue sky.


[PDI05] Paz's 5th Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: It was lovely out today, so I decided to sun myself in a lounge chair up on
     the deck when Strangelove came up to me. Despite the heat, she was in her
     usual long sleeves and pants. I waved at her. She looked away and mumbled,
     "H-hello there. Fancy meeting you here." I asked if she needed anything,
     feeling her eyes creeping up and down my body, like she was savoring it.
     Finally she swallowed and said, "You have such beautiful skin..."
     Bewildered, I shook my head and said, "No, not at all." I'd heard rumors
     that she was a... lesbian. But she couldn't be after me, could she? She
     continued to stare and said, "No, it is beautiful. But you must not let
     yourself get so tanned." And then she took my hand in hers. "What is wrong
     with a little sun?" I asked, trying to cut the conversation short. But she
     shook her head violently. "No! You mustn't! A young lady should take better
     care of her skin!" She was acting strangely, now, as if aroused. She
     lectured me on the perils of tanning - how it ages skin, causing wrinkles
     and spots, and in the worst cases even skin cancer. I knew already that
     tanning could cause spots, but I thought only pale-skinned Anglo-Saxons had
     to deal with that. Having a scientist tell me it causes aging, though -
     that spooked me a little. If I am to keep playing the teenager, I will have
     to start paying more attention to my skin. Sensing my anxiety, she took a
     small tube from her pocket. She said it was the sunscreen she always used.
     She told me to keep it. I didn't know what to say. I was more than happy to
     take it, but exactly what were her intentions? Was she merely being nice?
     Or is she really into me? Either way, there was no reason to refuse, I
     suppose. I have undergone training. An out-of-shape woman does <not|n't>
     pose any real threat to me. Having power means not being afraid. It is the
     same on a global scale: a country with nukes can dictate terms to a country
     without them. I thanked her and took the tube. Then she offered to put some
     on for me. She squirted some lotion onto her fingers and began rubbing it
     into my chest. It happened so suddenly, and I was so taken aback that I did
     not even think to protest. She caressed my stomach with her long, white
     fingers, then slid them upwards between my bikini-clad breasts. "Wha-?
     Wait..." I sputtered as her moist eyes met mine. She was beautiful...
     Somehow, I found myself captivated by this woman more than ten years my
     elder. "Hold still," she whispered in my ear. I nodded silently, unable to
     refuse. My body went limp, motionless, as if in a trance. Gently,
     carefully, she rubbed the lotion all over my entire body. I shouldn't have
     enjoyed it. And yet I could not help myself. For a moment, I was
     spellbound. That woman is dangerous... I had better watch myself.


[PDI06] Paz's 6th Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: Protecting one's health is an important part of any agent's job, but
     despite my best efforts, I have caught a cold. Now that I think about it,
     Mother Base's numbers are on the rise, with soldiers coming from all
     different places and backgrounds. It is no wonder, then, that sooner or
     later someone would bring in a virus. That said, what I have got is just a
     common cold. The medical team said I'd need a few days' rest, so I've been
     restricted to my room and put on bed rest. I thought I'd gotten used to not
     having anyone around to relate to... But at times like these, being alone
     is just... miserable. All I could do is lay there and stroke Nuke's back,
     trying to take my mind off how bad I felt. Nuke just sat there, not making
     a sound. But I did have visitors: Amanda and Chico, Huey, Cecile, Miller,
     and a few of the soldiers I've become relatively close to. Amanda made me a
     soup with herbs she said were good for a cold. Miller told me to take it
     easy. "I will sing you a lullaby," he said, then broke out a guitar and
     sang some incomprehensible song in Japanese. I did not need to understand
     the lyrics to know he's an awful singer. Then he said, "You know what is
     good for a cold? Suppositories! Here, I'll show you..." He began to take
     off his pants, so I threw my tissue box at him to make him go away. Then
     Strangelove showed up, saying she had some miracle Indian cure. "It has got
     eucalyptus extract," she said. "It works best if you rub it into your
     chest." And then she tried to take off my nightshirt. I whacked her with my
     pillow. And that got rid of her. Chico brought me a little flower in a cup.
     It had been growing in a little bit of earth that probably found its way on
     board stuck to something else. "I found this on the deck. Here, you can
     have it." He tried to act nonchalant, but I'm pretty sure he's got a crush
     on me. None of them understand. If they thought these little visits would
     cheer me up, they were wrong. Tonight, Snake himself came to my room. Like
     the rest, he believes I am just a schoolgirl, and treats me as such. "Why
     did you abandon your country," I asked him. "Why create the MSF?" Of
     course, I knew the answers already. But I wanted to hear it from him. As I
     had imagined, he was not exactly forthcoming. All he would say is that his
     country abandoned him because all he could do was fight. And that is why he
     needed the MSF - because that is all he is any good for. Then he said,
     "Fighting is the only thing I understand. But that does not mean I have got
     a grudge against those who believe in peace." I am not one of them, and I
     do not believe in peace. Conflict is in man's nature. We fight our enemies
     in order to survive. Maybe we're> not so different after all, he and I. But
     that is exactly why I am going to have to kill him. Or else he will have to
     kill me. When I stop and think about this wretched existence, being killed
     by a man like that suddenly does not seem like such a bad thing.


[PDI07] Paz's 7th Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: Every month, Mother Base throws a party for all the soldiers whose
     birthdays fall in that month. There's something strange about a military
     organization having parties. Really, though, it is just an excuse to drink
     and make noise. It is not easy to get alcohol on a fortress in the middle
     of the ocean. Most days they are training from dawn till dusk. They do not
     have time for things like drinking. That is why Snake and Miller came up
     with the idea - to give everyone a chance to let loose. Obviously, a bunch
     of boors like that are not going to bother with blowing out candles on a
     cake. Rather, they sit there in a cloud of cigarette smoke, drink beer, eat
     meat, tell tasteless jokes and swap crude insults about one another's
     hometowns. But it hardly ever breaks out into something serious. They talk
     up a storm, but they're just having fun. It is funny. You <have|'ve> got
     members of FSLN rubbing shoulders with the UCLAs. People who once would
     have considered the other mortal enemies. I wonder if that is what makes
     Big Boss so popular. In leaving their countries behind, they leave their
     hatred for other countries, too. Miller seemed a little protective of me.
     "Hope they're not being too crude," he said. But soon enough he too was
     drunk. He yelled, "C'mere and take a look at the REAL Kazuhira Miller!"
     then dropped his pants and mooned everybody. The other soldiers burst out
     laughing. I have never seen such a crude, ridiculous party before. And
     yet... All these people, laughing and acting the fool - is this what they
     call peace? For some reason, I began to think about all that has happened
     since I came here. Fishing with Chico, cooking with Amanda and Cecile,
     playing soccer, having visitors when I caught a cold... When I stop and
     think about it, my time here has been the most peaceful of my life. But
     that is about to end. I cannot imagine he <will|'ll> be willing to
     negotiate. It seems I am to fight the legendary Big Boss. I do <not|n't>
     know if I'll be able to beat him, but if I have to choose between death and
     defying Cipher, I will gladly choose death. The thought of dying does not
     scare me. But if I disobey my orders, the fear and despair awaiting me will
     be far worse than anything I can imagine. It was Cipher who took me in as
     an orphan - gave me food and a place to live. His orders may have been
     unreasonable, but I will never repay my debt entirely. It seems I have no
     choice. I must fight this man... I must fight Snake.


[PDI08] Paz's 8th Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: D'you know Miller, Snake's right hand man? Apparently he's got at least one
     serious weakness. He is an insatiable womanizer. He does not bother me,
     most likely because he considers teenagers off limits. But he has hit on
     every single one of the few female solders here at Mother Base. They ought
     to be telling him where to stick it, but end up falling for it so easily. I
     think some of it stems from the fact that he is actually not that bad
     looking. Anyway, today that nasty habit got him in trouble. He and Snake
     got into one of their rare fights, and I was there to see it. They burst
     out of the showers, completely naked, trading punches. I am no child - the
     sight of a naked man does <notn't> make me blush. But this was something
     else. "Maybe this'll teach you!" Snake yelled as he slammed his fists into
     Miller's chest. I heard later that apparently he'd been two-timing
     someone... and that same someone had gone to Snake with her troubles. As I
     see it, it is her own fault for letting herself be deceived like that. If
     she's too dumb to see though Miller's lies, then she got what she deserved.
     But this was not the first time it had happened, or the second, and Snake
     read Miller the riot act. Miller argued back, and what began as a shouting
     match turned into a fistfight. "You son of a bitch!" Miller yelled as he
     swung. "Not bad," said Snake, smiling. "But not good enough!" And then he
     was back on the offensive. They had already been at it pretty hard in the
     showers, and their bodies were covered with bruises. Both of these men had
     been trained for war, their bodies deadly weapons. They were each bleeding
     from a dozen places. All this from a fistfight. Even so, it was far less
     gruesome than if they had given it their all. It was obvious that one of
     them would be dead were they fighting for real. Miller took another swing,
     yelling, "Try this, then!" Snake parried, then responded in kind. But I
     could tell he was not aiming for anything vital. "You <are|'re> one tough
     bastard, Boss..." Miller muttered. A smile crept across his face as he
     caught his breath. And then they went right on fighting. Blood and sweat
     flew off their glistening bodies. It was combat without hatred or hostile
     intent. I'd never seen violence like this before. And yet it was more than
     just a friendly tussle. They were utilizing every technique they knew. It
     was not a sporting match - they were not playing by rules. How could they
     keep this up? At last, the two men tired themselves out, and the bizarre
     scene came to an end. They looked at each other's battered bodies, and then
     burst out laughing, embracing and congratulating each other on a good
     fight. It all seemed so idiotic. I still cannot fathom such behavior. But
     somehow I got the sense that for all his womanizing, Miller really only
     trusted one person, and that was Snake. There was no way I could ever come
     between the two of them. And at that thought I began to feel as if I had
     lost.


[PDI09] Paz's 9th Diary Entry
–----------------------------
PAZ: All of Mother Base is preparing for a festival. Since Snake and his
     soldiers spend so much time fighting, they're setting aside one day a year
     for peace and relaxation. I do not know all the details, but apparently
     that is what Snake and Miller decided. The soldiers love the idea, of
     course. There is so little fun to be had here that everybody looks forward
     to events like these. That is all well and good, but somehow I got roped
     into getting on stage... "C'mon, we even both have 'peace' in our names,"
     said Miller. "And Zadornov - that old Russkie's name has something to do
     with peace, too, right? "Hey, as long as we're having a day of peace, we
     ought to get an act together - The Three Peace Band!" I thought he was
     joking. He then proceeded to share his idea without bothering to check with
     me, and now I am slated to sing. Apparently, he had heard me on deck one
     day and since then he's wanted to form a band. Everybody's looking forward
     to it, so there is no way for me to back out now. I have never done
     anything like this, but it does feel kind of nice to know that people are
     looking forward to it. I mean, it cannot be any worse than Miller's
     singing. But modifications to ZEKE are already finalized, and I must
     complete my mission. Betray Cipher now, and I will face a fate far worse
     than death. Still... There's no need to put things in motion just yet. What
     difference would it make to just wait a little while longer? A whole day of
     peace... The mission can wait until after that, can it not? I know I am
     only delaying the inevitable. When the day comes, one of us will have to
     die - Snake or me. But still... If I could just come up with some way to
     stall Cipher... at least until our day of peace... When did I start having
     thoughts like this...?


[PDI10] Paz's 10th Diary Entry
–-----------------------------
PAZ: My cover is blown! They know nothing of Cipher or my true objective, but
     they know I am a spy. There's no more time left. I must act now. I must
     complete my mission... How did it come to this... All I wanted was three
     more days, just three... Miller's already finished writing the song. It
     <is|'s> called "Love Deterrent " - it is about a girl who can<not|'t>
     express her true feelings. I have been practicing. I am no pro, but I was
     pretty sure I would do a decent job. And now this... Cipher found out that
     ZEKE was complete. He must have someone inside Mother Base besides me.
     Spinning his tightly wound web of control, leaving no room for individual
     will - typical. When they found out ZEKE was complete, I was ordered to
     execute the operation immediately. If I was going to enjoy just one day of
     peace, I had to ensure the plan could not move forward. ...I tried to
     sabotage ZEKE. I thought by damaging the drive system, they would have no
     choice but to delay their plans... I waited until midnight and then snuck
     into the hangar. There would be trouble if it looked like sabotage. I
     selected one of the drive system's load-bearing parts and carefully worked
     to warp its shape. The legs' drive system requires a high degree of
     precision to operate. Even the smallest deviation would have done it. Then
     Chico walked in. Maybe it was one of those nights where he could not sleep.
     In any case, he saw me, panicked, and took off running. It would have been
     easy to kill him. But I could not! I know he... likes me. It is not as if I
     would ever have an interest in a child like him... But I could not pull the
     trigger. Not at him. Not in the back. Will he tell them? Or is there a
     chance he will keep it secret? Protect me... ...No. He knows now... Knows I
     am not who he thought I was... He ran without even questioning what I was
     doing. There is no chance he does not know. And soon, all I have built here
     will end. And if Cipher has another agent among them... If he finds out I
     tried to sabotage ZEKE... This place will no longer be my "heaven." ...Then
     it is settled. I make my move now. Chico walked in before my sabotage was
     complete, so ZEKE should still be operational. It might not run at full
     speed or power, but I do not have time to fix that. Without ZEKE, I do not
     have a chance in hell of winning. I must act fast before Chico sounds the
     alarm... I knew it would come to this. I just... did not think it would be
     so soon... ...It is time, ZEKE. Metal Gear ZEKE, activate!
